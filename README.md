# ProjectOverdrive
ProjectOverdrive started as a Google Code Project and is in the process of being migrated to GitHub.
Farewell old friend.

ProjectOverdrive is the big brother of Turbocharger and was develped to handle 6 high power motors (24V @ 20A ea) and have 6 encoder counters designed for an Arduino Due. This was originally meant as an aid to Bucknell Senior Design teams who needed a little more power to drive motors with encoders, but did not have programming experience beyond Arduino. Designed for Arduino Due.

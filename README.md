# Project Overdrive and TurboCharge
ProjectOverdrive is the big brother of Turbocharger and was develped to handle 6 high power motors (24V @ 20A ea) and have 6 encoder counters designed for an Arduino Due. This was originally meant as an aid to Bucknell Senior Design teams who needed a little more power to drive motors with encoders, but did not have programming experience beyond Arduino. Designed for Arduino Due.

Project TurboCharge is the little brother, powered from a L298P dual H-bridge, and fits nicely on top of an Arduino Uno.  It has two channels of encoder counting using the same chip as its big brother.  Its signficantly cheaper than the TurboCharge, making it the ideal candidate for projects requiring smaller motors.

Check out the documentation directory for more information on using the TurboCharge board, OverDrive board, or the US Digital Encoder Counters.

This project is currently maintained by Ward Prescott (erp006@bucknell.edu), however Phil Diefenderfer is responsible for the current hardware design and the first draft of the documentation and libraries.

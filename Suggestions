Suggestions from Ward:

1) Make there be a seperate Turbo charge and overdrive library.  Each should have examples that are preloaded, and each should reference the LS7366R library.

2) Put some basic motor control in the examples so users can quickly prove to themselves that motor and encoder control is working.
